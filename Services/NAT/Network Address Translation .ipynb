    "# What is NAT ? \n",
    "* internet is a big network \n",
    "* Number of devices are more than number of addresses in 32bit space \n",
    "* IP addressing is managed (public, private) : RFC1918\n",
    "* private to public translation : NAT\n",
    "* original NAT was 1:1 translation - during access one prvate address exclusively got translated into a public one\n",
    "    - Not feasible approach in present day\n",
    "    - it used to use a translation table (private : public) called a NAT table\n",
    "* NAT was extende to meet requirements using Port Address Translation (PAT)\n",
    "    - _overlads_ a single public address to a number of private addresses \n",
    "    - PAT table = Indside Address __(private ip + Source port) : Outside address (Public IP + Destiation port)__\n",
    "    - ports are generated by the OS (Use __`netstat`__ to see all active ports)\n",
    "    - even if two end devices generates same port number, collision is detected in router and asks the later PC to generate the next available port number. "
