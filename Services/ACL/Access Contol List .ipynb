    "    - receives a packet \n",
    "    - look up the routing table \n",
    "    - forwards to the appropreate port \n",
    "* what if we need a secure forwarding ? \n",
    "    - internet uses public IP and networks behind the routers uses private which is not reachable through the internet. malicious user makes the internal network to access a publicy available roughe resource to compromise the source, called _reverse shell_. \n",
    "* ACL is more used Internally than Externally \n",
    "    - protectig networks from insiders (within your orgnanization) is more challenging \n",
    "* ACL is not limited only to security ( _list of permit/deny statement_ )\n",
    "    - permit/deny an IP address\n",
    "    - permit/deny a port for a IP address \n",
    "* Usage \n",
    "    1. Access Control : typicall blocking of traffic \n",
    "    2. NAT : which address to be translated \n",
    "    3. QoS : Traffic engineering on a specific set of IPs\n",
    "    4. PBR\n",
    "    5. Route Filtering \n",
    "* ACL rules \n",
    "    1. read top-down\n",
    "    2. order matters, stops at the first match \n",
    "    3. Implicit dely at the last \n",
    "    4. ACL is applied inbound/outbound, think bounds as your are the router !\n",
    "    4. systax : `access-list [num] [permit | deny] [ip addr] [wc] `\n",
    "    5. each enry has a sequence number, increases by 10\n",
    "* ACL types\n",
    "    1. Standard (basic) \n",
    "        - matches based on sourse address (rarely used for security)\n",
    "        - lower processor unitlization\n",
    "    2. Extended (advanced)\n",
    "        - Matches based on source/destination address, port, protocol \n",
    "        - higher processor utilization\n",
    "    3. Reflexive (Stateful) \n",
    "        - Allowes return traffic for internal requests \n",
    "    4. Named access-lists \n",
    "        - `ip access-list [name] `"
