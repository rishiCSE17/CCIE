    "## IP Routing Processes \n",
    "* Packet routing steps \n",
    "    1. Routing - Find outgoing interface for a packet \n",
    "    2. switching - move packets between interfaces (Processe switch, Fast switching, CEF) \n",
    "    3. Encapsulation - rebuild the packet's L2 header\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps 1 : Routing process\n",
    "1. Packet enters to the router \n",
    "2. Find the __Longest Prefix match__ algorithm to match a destination from routing table \n",
    "    * `sh ip route 1.2.3.4`\n",
    "3. Find the outgoing interface using __Recursive Lookup__ \n",
    "    * `1.2.3.4 via 5.6.7.8`\n",
    "    * `5.6.7.8 via 9.0.1.2`\n",
    "    * `9.0.1.2 via 3.4.5.6`\n",
    "    * `3.4.5.6 Directly connected F1/0`\n",
    "4. A route can't be installed on the routing table untill it passes the recursive lookup process\n",
    "    * to see the actual recursive lookup process use `sh ip cef` command \n",
    "5. If multiple longest prefix matches take place \n",
    "    * Same protocol \n",
    "        * Choose lowest metric, if metric are same then perform Load balancing (by default equal cost) \n",
    "        * Internal routes are preffered over external \n",
    "    * Different protocols\n",
    "        * Choolse lowest AD\n",
    "        \n",
    "### Step 2 : Switchig process\n",
    "1. __Switching path__ : moving packets between interfaces (PS, FS, CEF)\n",
    "2. Load balancing in switching path, Per-flow/destination (default) , per-packet\n",
    "3. verification \n",
    "    * `sh ip interface` \n",
    "    * `sh ip cef [address] [detail]\n",
    "    * `sh ip cef exact-route [source] [destination]`\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Step 3: Encapsulation Process\n",
    "1. build the L2 header \n",
    "    * header type depends on engress interface (e.g. Ethernet, PPP etc.) \n",
    "2. for multipoint interface L3-L2 resolution ins required \n",
    "    * Ethernet : ARP \n",
    "        * Check the ARP cache : `show ip arp` \n",
    "        * if ARP miss, bradcast the request : `debug arp`\n",
    "    * mGRE DMVPN : NHRP\n",
    "        * check NHRP mapping table : `sh ip nhrp`\n",
    "        * if NHRP mapping miss, ask NHS : `debug nhrp` , `debug dmvpn` \n",
    "        \n",
    "There are two ways to find next hop, `ip route NET-ID MASK NH-IP` \n",
    "1. Recurse to interface : find the recursvely interface that reaches `NH-IP` matches \n",
    "2. If multipoint resolve next-hop : find L2 address of `NH-IP`\n",
    "3. if Point-to-point recursion is not needed \n",

    "## Reliable Static Routing \n",
    "* Only criteria to install a static route is the route-recursion process, however network status to the ingress interface is not known to the subjected router. \n",
