    "## Books\n",
    "1. Routing TCP/IP vol2 \n",
    "2. Developping IPv4 Multicast : https://epdf.pub/developing-ip-multicast-networks.html\n",
    "3. IP Multicast technology : https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/solutions_docs/ip_multicast/White_papers/mcst_ovr.html\n",
    "4. MC best practices : https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/ios-nx-os-software/multicast-enterprise/whitepaper_c11-474791.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Multicast ?\n",
    "* Multicast is a data transmission to a group of destination simultainusly (i.e. One-to-many communication). \n",
    "* As Opposed to:\n",
    "    1. __Unucast__ : One-to-one\n",
    "    2. __Broadcast__ : One-to-all\n",
    "    3. __Anycast__ :One-to-nearest one\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Why use Multicast ? \n",
    "The main goal of MC is to reduce the load on.\n",
    "1. __Sending server processing__ : sender sends one copy that gets replicated by the network.  \n",
    "2. __Network bandwidth resources__ : one copy of the feed is transferred through the netowork adn gets repicated at the interface level. \n",
    "3. __Router forwarding processing__ : Only one feed needs to be processed. \n",
    "4. __Receiving host processing__ : Hosts only receive packets for the groups they join. \n",
    "\n",
    "### why not just use Unicast ?\n",
    "* Sender generate one packet per destination (__head-end replication__)\n",
    "* Sender must know addresses of all destinations \n",
    "* router muust process packets for all destination \n",
    "* bandwidth use is proportional to the number of users, in MC the BW utilization is proportional to the number of senders. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why not Broadcast ? \n",
    "* Packets are forwarded on all packets except the receiving one, and can't be routed between multiple different subnets. \n",
    "* All users regardless of their need gets packets \n",
    "* results inefficient bandwidth utilization \n",
    "\n",
    "### How multicast optimises the Bandwidth ? \n",
    "* Source generate single data field for all interested recipient \n",
    "* source does not know who's recieving \n",
    "* Router makes single forwarding decission for all recipients \n",
    "* Only one packet is replicated per interface (saves bandwidth) \n",
    "* Unwilling hosts dont receive any packets. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages of Multicast\n",
    "IP Multicast is UDP only. Problem with __Connectionless__ transmission are,\n",
    "1. __Best-effort__ delivary : no ACK \n",
    "2. __No Congestion avoidence__: no Slow start and QoS\n",
    "3. __Possible Duplicatation__ : usually only the network is reconverging\n",
    "4. __Out-of-Order Packets__ : no sequencing \n",
    "\n",
    "## How multicast works? \n",
    "1. Source application _sends UDP multicast traffic with a group_ destination address. \n",
    "2. Ingterested receivers _join group addess_ by signalling its gateway routers \n",
    "3. Routers _build a loop-free tree_ from the sender to reciver\n",
    "4. data feed is _repilicated only for the willing hosts_ \n",
    "\n",
    "### Use cases\n",
    "1. Multimedia (e.g. IPTv, Video-conferencing, VoIP, music podcast )\n",
    "2. Data Distribution (large scale datacenter replication)\n",
    "3. Realtime application (stock tickers)\n",
    "\n",
    "## IPv4 MC components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Group addressing: \n",
    "* L2 and L3 addressing \n",
    "* Multicast __group__ is an address, aggreed upon between the sender and receivers for a particular feed. \n",
    "* Source sends traffic to the desination address of the group and all willing receivers recieve the feed. \n",
    "* traffic is always sent __to__ the gorup __never from__ (i.e. it's __Destination bound__).\n",
    "* group uses both L2 and L3 addresses\n",
    "* For __L3 addressing__ it uses class __D__ addresses $224.0.0.0/4 (224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255)$ including reserve addresses \n",
    "    1. __Link local address__ : `224.0.0.0` - `224.0.0.255`\n",
    "    2. __Source Specific MC__ : `232.0.0.0` - `232.255.255.255`\n",
    "    3. __Administratively scoped__ : Private `239.0.0.0` - `239.255.255.255`\n",
    "* IPv4 MC, __L3 addresses are mapped to a L2 (MAC)__ addresses to forward traffic on the LAN. This allows L2 _switches to forward MC_ intelligently (i.e. not to forward MC as BC).\n",
    "    1. MC MAC range is : `01-00-5E-00-00-00` to `01-00-5E-7F-FF-FF`\n",
    "    2. 25 MSBs are fixed and 23 LSBs are mapped from IPv4\n",
    "    3. To avoid overlap between MC groups, last 23 bits must be unique after mapping \n",
    "    4. __Mapping rule__ \n",
    "        1. IPv4 Address : $[224-239].X.Y.Z$\n",
    "        2. Convert second octat into binary and set the MSB as 0 i.e. $(X)_8 = (x_7 x_6 x_5 ... x_0)_2 \\rightarrow (0 x_6 x_5 ... x_0)_2=X'$\n",
    "        3. Convert $X'$ into Hex\n",
    "        4. Convert $Y$ and $Z$ directly to Hex\n",
    "    5. e.g. `224.0.0.1` = `01-00-5e-00-00-01`\n",
    "    6. e.g. `230.255.1.2` = `01-00-5e-7f-01-02`\n",
    "    6. e.g. `239.127.1.2` = `01-00-5e-7f-01-02` (overlapping with previous example) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.  Control plane:\n",
    "* Protocols: IGMP(host-router), PIM, MSDP (router-router), MBGP\n",
    "* Determinses: who's sending the traffic to what group and who's receiving traffic from what group __(s,G)__, and how the traffic will be forwarded (__the MC Tree__) \n",
    "* IGMP is used to signal the gateway router from the host to join a apecific group. (RFC: V1:1112, V2:2236, V3:3337)\n",
    "* IGMP Versions\n",
    "    * __IGMPv1__: uses two message types to signal group membership, __Host membership query__ (used by routers to verify if the members are still active, uses a groupwise __idle timer__) and __host membership report__ (used by host to signal joining). This version is replaced by version2\n",
    "    * __IGMPv2__: Enhances version 1 by adding 4 components __Querier Election__ (if multiple routers on the segment, who sends queries?), __Tunable Timers__ (can control query response timeouts), __Group specific Queries__ (Queries sent to the group address instead of the host) and __Explicit leave__ (speeds up convergence if no other hosts join that group). This version is backward compatible to version 1\n",
    "    * __IGMPv3__: Uses __Source specific multicast (SSM)__ i.e. v1 and v2 only support group specific joins $(*,G)$ whereas, v3 specify source as well $(S,G)$, this implies the receiver to know about the sender. \n",
    "* Once the gateway router $R$ is informed about $(S/*,G)$ by IGMP, $R$ has to inform the network to get traffic from the source, this is done by the Multicast routing protocols i.e. __Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)__ not MBGP/MSDP \n",
    "* __PIM__ is a R-R communication to build a __Loop free tree__ from sender to reciever(s). It is __protocol Independent__ as it doesn't advertise its own topology information, relies on the underlying IGP protocols that build the loop free topology. __Versions__(PIMv1,v2), __Modes__(Sparse, Dense) controlls how the tree will be built. \n",
    "    * __PIM Dense Mode__ : considers implicit join i.e. you recive all traffic unless you explicitly step out, this is called _flood and prune_ behaviour. \n",
    "    * __PIM Sparse Mode__: consideres explicit join i.e. you won't receive any traffic unless you explicity ask for it. uses __Rendezvous Point (RP)__ to process the join requests. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 2.  Data Plane:\n",
    "* Once the MC-tree is built, traffic begins to flow but before forwarding Data-plane checks occur. \n",
    "* __Reverse Path forwarding (RPF)__ check - this is a loop prevension mechanism in MC, i.e. was traffic recived on the correct interface ? When a MC packet appears to an interface of a router, _if the incomming interface = outgoing intrface for the source address of the MC packet by as per CEF_ , then it passes RPF check check, otherwise fails and the router drops the packet (MC ingress must be UC egress). Tis reles on the loop free topology built by the unlderlying IGP. \n",
    "* MC routing table (MRIB, MFIB) - what interface should the traffic be forwarded to ? AN inteface facing upstream towards the source if called incomming and interfaces facing towards the receivers are the outgoing interface list (OIL). __MC split-horizon__ suggests an incomming interface can't belong to OIL for a given MC.
