    "* CEF creates virtual RIB and FIB for each VRF and manages them parallelly.\n",
    "* Without VRF, all customer routes would have stored into the global routing table, which may lead them to be advertised to other customer. Since cusomer isolation is required __ACL based route filtering__ was used. The problem is, this is not a scalable solution. \n",
    "* All non VRF routes are placed into global routing table\n",
    "* Route-sharing among VRFs are not possible by default untill addition confing are done \n",

    "## Route Distinguisher value\n",
    "* Mandatory for each VRF. 32 bit IPv4 + 96 bits Prepend prefic (RD values)= unique 96 bits address called (VPNv4 address)\n",
    "    - eg. 500:1 + 10.0.0.0 \n",
    "    - naming convension : 500 represents ASN and 1 is index number\n",

    "    - site-to-site reachibility for customers is ensured by RD but it prevents shared access. \n",
    "    - Between PEs we have a MP-BGP tunnel that caries all VPN routes.With that another Extended-Community feature called _Route-target_ values\n",
    "    - VRFs are given RT values, all routes from that VRF caries respective RT values (Export RT). The other end of PE matches a set of RT (Import RT) values specific to VRFs on that router. If there's a match it accepts the route.  \n",
