## Redundancy and Loops
* Prevents switching loops 
* Original 802.1D for loop prevention 
* Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) : for probing and loop detection 
* __Boomering__ : 
* __Network Diameter__ : Max hop in a L2 networks. 
    > + Cisco recommends to limit diameter at 7  
    > + BPDU is transmitted (by default) each 2 sec, large diameter may collide two BPDU packets
